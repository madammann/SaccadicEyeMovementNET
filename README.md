# SaccadicEyeMovementNET

## About
In this project, intended as final project of the course “Implementing Artificial Neural Networks with TensorFlow”, we implement an ANN for image classification with a different approach than the typical CNN architecture.  
Supposedly more like human vision our “SaccadicEyeMovementNet” uses small image patches from different locations to classify an image.
